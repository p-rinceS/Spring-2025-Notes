Also Known as "Daily [[Scrum]]" or Syncs/sync-ups

Everyday a brief meeting is held where each team member shares:
	1. What did I accomplish since the last [[scrum]]?
	2. What do I plan on working before next [[scrum]]?
	3. Do I have any [[blockers]] or obstacles?


This is not a time for problem solving or traditional status meetings
The [scrum master](Scrum Master) addresses the obstacles or [[blockers]].



Guidelines for a good sync-up
	Take turns going first
	Everyone should participate
	Take any detailed/technical conversations offline
	Not a ritual or status meeting
	Inspect every task (go through the Jira board)
	Change the plan if needs to be changed
