A language with a well-defined [[syntax]] & [[semantics]] which is used to define queries


### Queries as functions

A query Q is a function that maps
	- databases (the input)
	- to relations (the query's output)
`Q(D)` denotes the result of evaluating the query Q over database instance D.

### Expressive Power

An query language Q1 is at least as expressive as query language Q2 if every query that can be expressed in Q1 can also be expressed in Q2.

The expressive power of two query languages Q1 and Q2 is the same if every query can be expressed mutually between Q1 & Q2.
