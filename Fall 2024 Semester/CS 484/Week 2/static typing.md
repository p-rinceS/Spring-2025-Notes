static typing means that the type of a variable is known at compile-time instead of runtime.


Once a variable is declared to be of a certain type in a statically typed language, it cannot be reassigned to a different type later.


[[TypeScript]] is statically typed because you cannot simply change the type of a variable after you declare it, it is type-safe.

[[JavaScript]] is not statically typed, instead it is dynamically typed, it can infer and change the types as the developer pleases, it is prone to error, where as TS will catch it in compile-time.
